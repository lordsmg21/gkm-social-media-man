### Typography System
**Font Pairing Strategy**: Poppins for headings (modern, friendly authority) with Inter for body text (excellent readability)

**Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard accessibility with visible focus indicators
**Screen Reader Support**: Semantic HTML and proper ARIA labels
**Color Independence**: Information never conveyed through color alone

## Edge Cases & Problem Scenarios
**Potential Obstacles**: 
- Network connectivity issues during real-time updates
- Large file uploads timing out or failing
- Mobile users accessing complex project boards
- Role confusion between admin and client permissions

**Edge Case Handling**:
- Offline state management with sync when reconnected
- Progressive file upload with resume capability
- Simplified mobile interfaces with essential features prioritized
- Clear visual indicators of user role and available actions

**Technical Constraints**: 
- 200MB file size limit for uploads
- Real-time features require WebSocket support
- Mobile browser compatibility for advanced features

## Implementation Considerations
**Scalability Needs**: Support for multiple GKM team members and growing client base
**Testing Focus**: Cross-browser compatibility, mobile responsiveness, real-time feature reliability
**Critical Questions**: 
- How to handle conflicting real-time updates from multiple users?
- What's the optimal balance between feature richness and mobile usability?
- How to maintain performance with large amounts of analytics data?

## Reflection
This approach uniquely serves GKM's need for premium client relationships by combining professional aesthetics with practical project management tools. The focus on "Started Conversations" as the primary metric aligns with their business model while the glassmorphism design reinforces their premium brand positioning.

The most critical assumption is that clients will embrace a more comprehensive platform over simpler alternatives - this should be validated through user feedback and usage analytics.

What would make this solution truly exceptional is the seamless integration of social media performance data with project management, creating a holistic view that no other tool provides for social media agencies.
